To this date, the chapter has implemented various projects and programs aligned to combat issues and create sustainable communities that are on par with other budding communities the world is currently molding The problems are too many to approach, hence, with the very limited number of forces working on its accomplishments or realizations, a big chunk of the goals was left unrealized. The emergence of unforeseen events such as the Covid 19 pandemic affects the entire world. We bring the key concepts of UNSDG to the grassroots, Increased number of Zamboagueños in terms of awareness of UNSDG, we don't want to limit the discussion of UNSDG to the academe or government agencies or the organizations whose main focus is UNSDG, but we want to make every Zamboangueños understands the very goals of UNSDG.</div>

JCI has been conducting impactful projects for 73 long years and its rich history has flourished through time. Hence, along with the current technological innovations, the chapter came up with a project that serves as a platform for the advancement of its mission. With this, the issue that this project aims to solve is to become an avenue that will aid advance the movement through a wider platform on the Internet.</div>
